# Using Greedy InfoMax with PointNet++
We use the Greedy InfoMax algorithm to train a PointNet++. Still in an experimentation phase. If successful, the algorithm may be used in learning deep representations of 3D point clouds using large unlabeled datasets, which can then be used in both classification and semantic segmentation.

## Dependencies and Usage
TBD
